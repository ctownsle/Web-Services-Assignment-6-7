<hr />
<p>Rebuild your entire project from scratch in <a href="http://www.dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</a>. Follow the tutorials to acquire a basic understanding, then reimplement your project at all levels: logic, presentation, data store, and services (both producing and consuming). Use the relevant parts of dropwizard to achieve what you need.</p>
<p><b>NB: use maven</b> as your project management tool. Follow the recommended maven project structure.</p>
<p>After this homework your project should be designed well in terms of api objects / resources / data access objects, complete, and working well.</p>
<p>Submit to the Blackboard dropbox your archived (zip or tar.gz) project directory. Demonstrate your homework within a week after the deadline.</p>

<hr />
<p>This is your last homework, and your Dropwizard project submission. At this point your Dropwizard implementation should be complete and everything should be working appropriately. Now you have two weeks before the final presentation to refactor your code base (without removing or breaking functionality).</p>
<p><b>NB: make sure that your project is RESTful</b>. Read the document on RESTful best practices and follow it religiously. (HATEOAS is not needed.) <b>This homework will be graded mainly on RESTfulness.</b></p>
<p>Submit to the Blackboard dropbox your archived (zip or tar.gz) project directory.</p>
<p>You will showcase this version of your project during Finals' week, so make sure it looks good. You will also show interesting pieces from the previous implementations of your project.</p>

# My Assignment

Final web-services project making sure that the API is perfectly restful, while extending the previous versions of the project. 

This is done using Dropwizard as the framework, and MySQL as a data repository, with the help of JDBI to store data in the database itself.
